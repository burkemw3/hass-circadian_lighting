This is a hack to test separating light brightness from sunset time. The goal is to allow lights to remain brighter for longer in the evening during the winter in upper latitudes.

The color temp follows the sunrise/set of HASS's location.

The brightness follows the sunrise/set is overrideable with the sunrise_time, sunset_time, sunrise_offset, and sunset_offset config values.
